<h2>importance of AI:</h2>
Artificial intelligence allows computer systems to work with the intellectual processes of humans.
However, these machines can carry out tasks more dexterously and efficiently than people. They can also enter hazardous environments,
 such as areas that require deep sea diving, making certain processes much safer.
 For these reasons, it’s currently being utilised by a variety of industries, including:
 (1)Healthcare:AI can mimic cognitive functions. This makes it a perfect fit within healthcare, where many issues need addressing to make treatments
 faster, more effective and more affordable.
 (2)Transport:Artificial intelligence is greatly improving the efficiency of the transport sector.
 It can help optimise routes, finding the fastest and safest journeys for different vehicles.
(3)Manufacturing: Adopting AI in different factories is helping to:
(a)Make certain processes safer by automating them
(b)Improve engineering efficiency
(c)Reduce costs
(d)Increase revenue
(e)Plan supply and demand
In short: AI is improving the way we work. It’s not about replacing humans, rather, changing our workplaces for the better.
